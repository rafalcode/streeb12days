good evening once again sir Arthur good
evening 

LK: we spoke yesterday about the history of the Streeb-Greeblings. I'd like now if I may to move on to your more immediate family near your father now what sort of relationship did you have with him?

SA: My father was a remote icy man. Remoter and icier and indeed manlier than I was.

LK: Were you close?

SA: Well he was he was closer than me but almost from the moment I was born he wanted no more to do with me. Not very paternal as a father instead he proposed to have me reared by wolves. Fortunately for me there were very few decent-sized wolves in the Aylesbury area at the time you know the only thing even remotely resembled a wolf was Aunt Mary's pekinese and my father in his wisdom drew the line at me being suckled by pekinese.

Pyrenees really why no no I
great respect for the Pekinese
they were the Chinese hunting dogs you
know where they only as a bridge were
tracked down the hippopotami that
infested the Futsoi Valley and dragged
them out of their warrens, hence the huge boggling eyes which they developed

yes now a lot of people think the
Pekinese developed that you would
boggling eyes and always for them to be
able to see in the dark down the
hippopotamus Warren's but not so no not
so not so at all the reason why the
Pekinese develop such huge boggling eyes
is purely one of surprise that any one
should ask them to perform such a such a
function it's terribly small Pekinese
and the hither by contrast is gigantic
and it would take about 500 people he's
working as a team to drag the hippo out
of its lair. So my father decided to have
me help me raised by goats I said I was

a child you ran free with the goats

SA: Noi, I was shackled to a post while I was way
of getting me to stand on my own two
feet two feet shorter and your second
gift to turtletales is there a
sentimental reason for that number I
that attacks helpless Turtles now I eat
them without compunction I must say
lovely lovely
firstly flavor as well as a taste for
turtle dabs you've retained I imagine a
lifelong fondness from the world of the
goat goats cheese goat's milk and so on
no no oddly enough I went off good
somewhat after being raised by them they
were taken to goats cheese though if you
go Quast coats hats shoes underwear
things like that but that's normal
like them but the actual cheese I've
never had much time for and what about
your mother
Oh my mother by contrast was a cinch
whenever I think of my dear mother I
have an abiding image of a small kindly
plump gray-haired lady posturing at the
sink. "Get away from the bloody sink", my mother would yell at her, "and get out of my kitchen you awful plump little kindly woman". Never found out who she was. Drove 
us start raving mad.

LK: Are you hinting there Sir Arthur at your father's breakdown?

SA: Yes indeed. One day quite without warning he became utterly convinced that he was a bat. He made a pathetic sight standing there in the middle of the village green asking the locals to throw cricket balls at him.

LK: And did they?

SA: Oh yes, we all did.  they all
joined in he was a deeply unpleasant and
very unpopular man but tough as teak, you have to give him that. never give in that he hung on in there
for about six hours about four o'clock
during the tea and of all they brought
on the heavy rail er and that did the
I think he'd have a pretty good innings

LK: Given the opportunity Sir Arthur is there any one thing that you wish you could say to your father now on
reflection?

SA: I think very much what I ought to have said to him at the time what was that something along the lines
of "Watch out papa, there's a heavy roller behind you".
