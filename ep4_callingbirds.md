# Four Calling Birds

LK: Sir Arthur you have traveled widely

SA: Yes I better to travel widely than to arrive
if you understand Mia several widens the
well as they say in the Sahara. "Arrive arrive arrive arrive 10 Dublin's fair
city but I'm short answer to your
question I suppose disease is yes thank
you young well

LK: What's your favorite place in the world?

SA: I think I'd have to say the the Galapagos Islands extraordinary creatures live there in the Galapagos beautiful little two-foot and millipede and then but one about particularly lodges in my mind is the
armadillos Lumos habaneros which are
extraordinary to see there they swim in
formation off the coast they're
absolutely dazzling

LK: What is the cause of their luminosity phosphorescence pink
paint yes no one has paint that's put on
them by whom by the painter bird these
are birds which ones a year fly over to
Latin America dive into huge vets of
luminous paint and then fly all the way
back and work themselves off on the
armadillosi.

LK: It does sound a little unlikely Sir Arthur if I may say so.

SA: Alot of things in nature unlikely I mean
who can imagine an animal called the prottle entirely made out of curtain
ringsi?

LK: Does such an animal exist?

SA: No, that's what I said, who could imagine it!


LK: Now for your fourth gift certainly

SA: Yes I would like four enormous larks please.

LK: Well I'm very sorry to tell you Sir Arthur that that has proved impossible at such short notice. We have in fact got you four calling birds.

SA: well calling Birds they are no bloody used to anybody. I ordered four enormous locks and you come up with calling Birds I mean calling Birds another line enormous larks I mean I was all geared
up to reminisce about various things and
frankly I insisted on four enormous dogs
with very good reason because who knows
Lots we did trigger off figure off
memories memories of I don't know what I
mean even though the four and almost
locked out here on the lawn and they
would they would trigger off a memory
but around four enormous actually I'm
along like they're all on the lawn
buffelgrass and anything it triggers
often sort of memory of just looking out
of the window announcing the lawn
completely denuded of laps which is not
as all of the I want to talk about at
all as with each calling birds they
they remind me of is it's how we sort of
have these four enormous locks here and
how annoying it is I mean it just seems
to reach the complete impasse okay you
where I believe in the twenties in
Maupin ass well in Paris in the 20s
oh yes in the trend is embarrassed with
all the will the locks in more panache
is it's a bit like London in the 60th
actually and in black-and-white and
without subtitles I was very poor rather
pathetically weasel moustache and I was
absolutely homeless I was young and I I
desperately wanted to paint you knocked
in the first door you came to yes and I
painted it there's no answer with the
door swung open and there in the center
of the room was his most peculiar
melting bed draped over an ironing board
I had stumbled into the garret of
Salvador Dali fascinating yeah what
looked like a melting mattress over an
ironing board was in fact his landlady
met I'm shipping your dolly himself had
to leave in a hurry due to an accident
with a burning Doral silly fool he could
never look after them and later you met
Edith Piaf yes in that very room I
remember I was talking to her on this
particular occasion she said to me sure
no regrets are real and I said "oh come on, Edith there must be something". She said absolutely not apart from possibly other players agreeing to come to this room this very evening.

you know I'd matter at matter for honest
you lived with Piaf in Paris for some
years I think no I said that the F in
Paris for some sevens but you did know
the surrealist will oh yes I loved the
surrealist very nice fellow beautifully
well behaved people in a bizarre kind of
Magritte was a pain in the ass there
with his boiled eggs on lamb peasant
dolly a little bit unreliable never
showed up of course but the rest of them
were great bunch of mates great bunch of
mates I was very much part of the floppy
floppy knowing that they moved in.

LK: What?

SA: I was very much part of the Profi propping ninth ninth that they moved in.

LK: Of the circle they moved in?

SA: No no no they
idea of also release moving round and
round in circles ludicrous comes another
picture which is completely surreal no
they didn't move in a circle they moved
and a hot water Bibble.

LK: A hot water bottle?

SA: Dibble. They despised hot water
models wouldn't have him in the house
bourgeois they said apart from Magritte
Magritte had a hot water bottle he was
to boil his eggs in it whenever he
needed one for a lamppost or whatever we
all disliked him intensely why we thought
it was a bit mad frightful little man
his bottom
thank you sir Arthur if you just if you
have the larks here then I could
remember something all I can remember is
you didn't bring the latter five
