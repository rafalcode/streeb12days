**LK:** Well Sir Arthur I very much enjoyed our talks.

**SA:** They've been fun haven't they.

**LK:** Yes but now we come at last to your final gift and what's that?

**SA:** My last gift I'm sure you've guessed it is 12 Lords a leaping

**LK:** Why have you chosen that?

**SA:** Well as a Christmasy thing really, to remind us all in this season of goodwill
of the 12 wise Lords who came leaping into the stable at Bethlehem at the birth of our saviour


LK: I don't think they did Sir Arthur

AR that oh yes boing boing boing as in the carol

LK: No I'm afraid you're mistaken you sure yes quite certain last yeah it's very confusing um now never remember
who
was in the stable must have been a the uh the hens
was it three hens no very sorry about this
was it the goats they in the stable uh partridges I'm oh par two Turtle dos Three French Lords four normous Lars 12 Leaping Lizards hens I'm a bit of a mdle not much of a Bible buff myself I'm afraid don't take much interesting Christmas it used to be great fun in the old days
    when it
was simply an orgy of commercial excess but now I find the people are tainting the
whole thing
with a lot of religious mumbo jumbo thank the Lord is over for another year yes I I
was going to ask you Sir Arthur how
will you spend the rest of your year oh
well uh the rest of the year that goes completely into preparation
with the gribling Fate I have to go around putting signs up on all the trees saying August the 4th fate to get the villagers interested I always start putting these up good and early on about August the 5th generally as soon as the previous Fate has lumbered to a close like to give plenty of notice you raise a lot of money for charity I understand oh an enormous amount yes an enormous amount because fortunately
we have very low overheads
what
we do is
we simply throw open the grounds and invite villagers in to buy Nettles grass goats sparrows
worms flies anything in fact that flourishes in the garden is theirs for under a f that money is then plowed back into my bank account do you have stalls for the produce or is it more pick your own
we find that people get more pleasure in picking their own and in pursuing the
worm particularly on their own that is a lonely sort of hunt the excitement that that sort of thing pick your own Nettles is is quite popular I suppose largely because the sign says mint as a result
we sell an awful lot of dock leaves my own favorite is the bring and buy aspect that villagers bring a lot of their stuff and then buy it back from us at a small percentage 100 I think it is yes a 100% they enjoy that and of course
we do have Peg dancing is that uh like Morris dancing yes it's very like Morris dancing really a
woman called Peg comes in and dances you're very fond of the gardens here at Greebling Sir Arthur? they

LK: Oh yes I'm tremendously tremendously fond of the gardens cuz
we keep them uh right outside here you see and they're they're absolutely beautiful that's
why I so completely devastated by those storms
we've been having recently they played Havoc
with the grounds had an enormous number of beautiful trees blown over blown over from the neighboring properties
which landed here and uh took root absolutely ruined the putting green nevertheless the garden is open again now and is very popular
with the public.

LK: Why do you think that is?

SA: Well I think probably people are attracted by by the enormous sign outside on the A34 saying Miniature Railway Farm Zoo vintage car museum tropical aquarium jousting exhibitions bonsai garden and licensed restaurant it is very impressive yes uh it is isn't it uh one of our neighbors the Duke of Bedford very kindly allowed us to steal it from him but gribling is not a large garden it's nothing like Wen or Blen him or any of those places it's a compact Garden
we have Vines of course oh no
we don't have Vines actually
we don't have any Vines at all not even a hint of a Vine but
we have uh
we have cacti
why do you think people keep coming because you don't have very many CI do you uh just the one
well as I say uh I have a hunch that the sign may have something to do
with it it is a lovely sign
we just keep it outside
we keep all the outside outside but more than that it's it's a garden you can get around in a day isn't it
well you can get around in a minute actually you don't have to
waste a
whole day trailing around the garden and your time is your own and entry is free is it entry yes it is free but exit is very very expensive it costs absolutely nothing to get in and Â£100 to get out it's a Walled Garden and aart from the cactus that's it
well finally Arthur I feel I've got to know you a lot better over these last 12 days but I'm still curious as to one thing
what is it in the end that you really believe in
well um I like to say I believed in God of course but I'm afraid there's a thinking person
who cares about the
world around him there two very good reasons
why I simply can't
what are they
well a
wasps can't see the point of a
wasp can you absolutely pointless and B caviar I mean really
what is the point of having caviar locked away inside sturgeon so inaccessible I'm sure if a real God he
would have arranged for caviar just to totle over to your house on a a pair of little legs in a self-opening jar Sir Arthur thank you oh thank you and uh season gings to you and of course your family [Music]
