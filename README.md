# Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling's Twelve days of Christmas from 1990.

This is a transcription of the twelve 5 minute programmes, prodcued by Talkback and broadcast by the BBC during the Christmas period of 1990.

They are of course BBC property, but the programme themselves can be viewed on Youtube.

Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling is a persona of Peter Cook, widely recognised as one the great comedic geniuses of the 
United Kingdom. Peter invented him while he was quite young, and from that period there is a famous sketch of a
Sir Arthur talking about his vain efforts teaching crows to swim underwater.

However there is some special about the elder Sir Arthur (Peter was only about 53 though) and besides the very sharp humour there is also a poignancy, especially in the third French Hens episode. It's hard not to think that there wa a slender connection between Sir Arthur and Peter himself.
